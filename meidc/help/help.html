<h2><a name="chapter1">1. Introduction </h2>
<p>
The Meilhaus Intelligent Device Configuration Utility (ME-iDC) offers you extensive features for service and configuration in combination with the Meilhaus Intelligent Driver System (ME-iDS). The usage is optional. Please terminate any process accessing
the driver system before running this utility!
</p>

<p>
Main Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easy access to device informations (subdevices, serial number, ranges, ...).</li>
  <li>The device number can be changed by moving the device entries.</li>
  <li>&quot;Memory function&quot; for devices, which were temporarily removed from the system. </li>
  <li> Registering accessories with the ME-iDS (e.g. ME-MultiSig system, ME-1001).</li>
  <li> Registering remote devices (e.g. ME-Synapse LAN).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following is a screenshot of the main window of the utility.

<h2><a name="chapter7">7. Register and Delete a ME-1001</h2>
<p>
It is possible to increase the channel count of a ME-1000/64 from 64 to 128 channels by adding
a ME-1001 extension board (= ME-1000/128). Thus you can inform the  driver system about the number of channels
(and subdevices) of your ME-1000 because of the driver system is not able to detect the extension by itself.
</p>

<p>
In order to do this select the subdevice list of the ME-1000 in the configuration tree by a left click.
With a right click on the selected subdevice list a popup menu appears with the appropriate command.
</p>

<p>
<img src="add_me1001.bmp">
</p>

<p>
If you add the ME-1001 extension board two additional &quot;DIO&quot; subdevices will be appended to the subdevice
list of the ME-1000.</p>

<p>
