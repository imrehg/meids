When library is build two version are created: universal (libmeids_unv.so) and local (libmeids_local.so).
Local version has reduced features therefore is smaller and faster.
Doesn't support:
- XML configuration file (generated by meIDC)
- RPC conections (SynapseLAN) 
By default universal is in use.
If you would like to switch to local version type "make link_local".
Restoring universal library can be done with "make link_unv".

NOTE: "make link_xxx" has to be called AFTER library instalation ("make install")
